Pycap-dss is a Python package for analyzing streamflow depletion and drawdown from pumping wells. It provides analytical solutions that are accessible and efficient compared to traditional methods, making it easier for analysts to evaluate the impacts of high-capacity pumping.
It is intended for use in scenarios where analytical solutions are appropriate and can be used to quickly screen proposed pumping impacts. The package is modular, allowing for easy addition of new solutions, and includes internal functions for direct access to specific analytical methods. However, it does not cover all possible solutions and is not a substitute for more complex modeling approaches in challenging hydrogeologic conditions.
