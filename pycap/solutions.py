    Compute streamflow depletion using Dudley Ward and Lough (2011) solution

    Dudley Ward and Lough (2011) presented a solution for streamflow depletion
    by a pumping well in a layered aquifer system.  The stream
    is in the upper aquifer, and the pumping well is in a lower
    aquifer that is separated from the upper aquifer by a
    semi-confining aquitard layer.
